        <h1> About Me </h1>
        <p> Name: Kervin Gabrido </p>
        <p> Nickname: Kerv </p>
        <p> Favorite CMSC subject so far and why: CMSC 22. I like the concept of object oriented programming. It was also the first CMSC subject where I got to see my code become something as visual as a game. </p>
        <p> Favorite GE so far and why: MATH 10. I am interested in the history of Mathematics and how it applies to different aspects of society. </p>
        <p> Favorite programming language so far and why: Python. It was the easiest to learn; not a lot of wacky syntax. </p>
        <p> Favorite food: White corn on the cob. </p>
        <p> Hobbies: Watching Asian series and playing video games. </p>
        <p> What was my childhood dream: To become an astronaut. </p>
